# ðŸ’» Bash Boilerplate Practice â€“ freeCodeCamp Relational Database Management Course

Welcome to my forked repository from the freeCodeCamp **"Learn Bash by Building a Boilerplate"** project. This project served as a practical introduction to working in the Linux environment using Bash, while also exploring essential tools involved in modern web and backend development.
